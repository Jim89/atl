# Atlanta poster

Small repo using [ggirl](https://github.com/jnolis/ggirl) to make a poster for
my room of a street map of Atlanta with my old street highlighted.

Data provided as a shapefile in the `.zip` file, originally downloaded from
here: https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=94bce05f7feb4a7ca63cffa0de29833d

"Atlanta" font is Harvey Script, sourced from
https://www.fontspace.com/harvey-script-font-f44520 (free/unrestricted for
personal use). Was as close as I could find to the [Creature
Comforts](https://creaturecomfortsbeer.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/creature-comforts-beer-logo-black.png)
font. Not _quite_ as nice, but very good for free!

Thanks to Jacqueline Nolis for the `ggirl` package!
